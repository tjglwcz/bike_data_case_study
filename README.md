# Google Data Analytics Case Study: How Does a Bike Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## Introduction

This project was made as a part of an optional Capstone Project in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera.
I took the role of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at **Cyclistic**, a bike sharing company from Chicago. My main task was to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. The insights are going to be the base for a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oﬀering. Since then, the program has grown to a ﬂeet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the ﬂexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as **casual riders**. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are **Cyclistic members**.

Cyclistic’s ﬁnance analysts have concluded that **annual members are much more proﬁtable than casual riders**. Although the
pricing ﬂexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the marketing director believes that maximizing the number of annual members will
be key to future growth.

The marketing director has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders diﬀer, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aﬀect their marketing tactics.
